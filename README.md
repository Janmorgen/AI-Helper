## NOTE
This is a project I made for recreational use only, it should not be relied on to produce errorless information. As such the output of the program should not be relied on for any important/critical usecases, especially if it affects any other users.

## Usage
To use the system you need Ollama installed on your local computer (this can be changed by modifying the agent IP address)
- `# apt install Ollama`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- (Optional) add documents to /html, /pdf, /code to embed them to chromaDB, allowing the AI to access local data
- `python main.py`
